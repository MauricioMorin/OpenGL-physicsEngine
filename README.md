# Simple Physics Engine with OpenGL

This is a self-built 3D physics simulation project written in C++, featuring real-time rendering with OpenGL and a custom **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture. The simulation includes basic physics such as **bouncing spheres inside a box** with simple collision detection and response.

## âœ¨ Features

- **OpenGL 3D rendering** with lighting, shaders, and camera control  
- **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** for modular and scalable architecture  
- **Basic physics simulation** (collision detection between spheres and walls)  
- Real-time rendering and interaction
